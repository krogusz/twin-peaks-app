      "desc": "Audrey is 18 years old during the series. She eventually discovers that her father, business magnate Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), was the deceased Laura Palmer's (Sheryl Lee) lover. Audrey is labeled a troublemaker and she initially lives up to that expectation. In a memorable scene in the Twin Peaks pilot, she derails one of her father's business deals, worth millions of dollars, by interrupting a meeting of Norwegian investors and telling them about Laura's murder. Although Audrey and Laura were not friends, Audrey says she \"kind of loved Laura\" because she tutored Audrey's mentally handicapped brother Johnny (Robert Bauer). During the first season of Twin Peaks, Audrey develops a crush on FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan). She tries to help him investigate Laura's murder by infiltrating a Canadian brothel, One-Eyed Jack's, as a hostess. She remains at the brothel for several episodes that bridge the series' first and second seasons, in danger of her life, while she makes some profoundly disturbing discoveries. In the show's second season, writers planned a serious relationship between Cooper and Audrey, but MacLachlan vetoed the plan; he argued that Cooper would not become involved with a teenaged girl. (Fenn later revealed that costar Lara Flynn Boyle, who was dating Kyle MacLachlan at the time, \"put the kibosh\" on Audrey and Cooper's romantic arch) Cooper admits to Audrey during their last significant conversation that the real reason why he would not pursue her was for her own safety. In a previous FBI case, he had fallen in love with a young woman who was then murdered.Later in the second season, Audrey flirts with Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and then falls in love with one of her father's business associates, John Justice Wheeler (Billy Zane). She finds evidence to exonerate Cooper of charges pressed after his raid on One-Eyed Jack's. She also lets her father pressure her into entering the Miss Twin Peaks beauty pageant, for which she delivers an impassioned speech in favor of saving endangered species. In the series finale, Audrey is engaged in an act of civil disobedience at the local bank to save the local forest. After chaining herself to the door of the bank vault, a bomb explodes inside the vault, a booby trap planted by the late Thomas Eckhardt (David Warner) as an ironic reward in a long treasure hunt. Andrew Packard (Dan O'Herlihy), Pete Martell (Jack Nance), and an elderly banker are the ones closest to the blast, and Audrey's fate is left ambiguous. In the finale, it is suggested that Audrey is actually the half-sister of classmate Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle), whose biological father turns out to be Benjamin Horne.Fenn stated in an interactive chat on America Online that, if there had been a third season of the show, her character was slated to have survived the explosion."

      "desc": "Born on April 19, 1954, Dale Cooper is a graduate of Germantown Friends School and Haverford College. He is quirky and intellectual, with a profound interest in the mystical, particularly in Tibet and Native American mythology. Much of his work is based on intuition and even dreams. On joining the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cooper was based at the Bureau offices in Philadelphia. It was here that Cooper was partnered with the older Windom Earle. At some point, Cooper would be placed under the authority of FBI Chief Gordon Cole, which sometimes meant being handed the mysterious 'Blue Rose' cases. Some time after Cooper joined the Bureau, Earle's wife, Caroline, was a witness to a federal crime. Earle and Cooper were assigned to protect her, and it was around this time that Cooper began an affair with Caroline. However, one night, while in Pittsburgh, Cooper let his guard down, and Earle murdered Caroline in a jealous rage. Earle was subsequently sent to a mental institution. Cooper was devastated by the loss of the woman he would later refer to as the love of his life, and swore to never again get involved with someone who was a part of a case to which he was assigned.Three years before his arrival in Twin Peaks, Cooper has a dream involving the plight of the Tibetan people, which also reveals to him the deductive technique of the Tibetan method. Deeply moved by what he saw in this dream, this event forms the basis of his unconventional methods of investigation. Cooper reveals to his boss, Cole, of the portents of a strange dream.On February 24, 1989, Cooper comes to the town of Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of Laura Palmer. Initially, the prime suspect is Laura's boyfriend Bobby Briggs, but Cooper quickly determines he is innocent. Cooper meets Phillip Gerard, a shoe salesman who is possessed by an evil spirit called MIKE; MIKE tells him that another demon, BOB, is the key to solving Laura's murder. Eventually, Cooper deduces that Laura's father, Leland, murdered her while possessed by BOB. When BOB forces Leland to commit suicide, Cooper helps him transition into the afterlife by reciting a Buddhist prayer for the dead.Cooper helps the Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department in investigating other cases as well, even during a brief suspension from the FBI. While in Twin Peaks, he learns of the mysterious places called the Black Lodge and the White Lodge and the various spirits inhabiting them, including MIKE and The Man From Another Place. He also resolves to protect the town from Earle, who has become a serial killer.In the final episode of Twin Peaks, Cooper enters the Black Lodge to rescue his new girlfriend, Annie Blackburn, from Earle. In the Black Lodge, he encounters his evil doppelgänger, who is in league with BOB. Earle appears and says he will let Annie go if Cooper gives him his soul. Cooper agrees, and Earle stabs him in the stomach. Seconds later, BOB appears and reverses time in the Lodge. BOB tells Cooper that Earle cannot ask for his soul, and then kills Earle and takes his soul. BOB then turns on Cooper, who flees, pursued by BOB and Cooper's doppelgänger. BOB allows Cooper's doppelgänger to leave the Black Lodge, while Cooper remains there. In the show's final scene, the doppelgänger smashes Cooper's head into a mirror and starts laughing hysterically; BOB's face looks back at him in the broken mirror."

      "name": "Harry S. Truman",

      "desc": "Harry S. Truman is Twin Peaks' sheriff, who assists Special Agent Dale Cooper in the investigation of the murder of Laura Palmer. Harry is in love with the fragile Josie Packard, and is also one of the Bookhouse Boys.Harry and Cooper hit it off almost from the start. Harry is down-to-earth and plain-spoken, which often sharply contrasts with the eccentric Cooper and his unconventional methods of policing, fascination with Tibet, dreams, etc. Harry regards Cooper as somewhat eccentric but well-meaning. In early episodes, Harry serves to introduce Cooper (and hence the viewer) to the more prominent residents of Twin Peaks. Harry states that he begins to feel that he is Dr. Watson to Cooper's Sherlock Holmes. Despite their differences, Truman represents a literary alternate to Cooper: they approach the same goal through different means. As the case progress, Harry's respect for Cooper (and vice versa) grows and the two become close friends. He regards Cooper as \"the finest lawman he has ever known\". He vehemently defends Cooper to the FBI when Cooper is suspended for allegedly trafficking drugs across the Canada–US border, and assists him in rescuing Audrey Horne from One-Eyed Jacks. Harry shares his name with Harry S. Truman, the 33rd President of the United States. A picture of President Truman appears in his office. Additionally, a stuffed and mounted buck's head on his office wall has a placard reading \"The Buck Stopped Here\" hanging from it, a reference to the famous \"The buck stops here\" sign President Truman put on his desk. Harry's passionate love for Josie Packard is such that it blinds him to the fact that she is merely using him, as she has used many other people. When she dies suddenly after murdering Thomas Eckhardt, Harry falls into a deep depression and takes to drinking. He manages to turn himself around when Eckhardt's personal assistant Jones makes an attempt to murder him, which he thwarts. Following this, Harry resumes being the dedicated partner to Cooper he was before. When Cooper disappears into the Black Lodge Harry tirelessly waits for hours, until his sudden reappearance.By 2014, Harry is afflicted with an unidentified illness that renders him unable to serve as sheriff. His duties are assumed by his older brother Frank, who comes out of retirement after a prior tenure as Twin Peaks sheriff."

      "name": "Laura Palmer",
      "img": "https://bi.im-g.pl/im/a9/d3/14/z21837737V,Laura-Palmer.jpg",
      "desc":"Laura , was well known and loved in Twin Peaks; she volunteered at Meals on Wheels, was her school's Homecoming Queen, and was (apparently) the darling of her parents, Sarah and Leland. However, the series gradually revealed that Laura led a double life: she was a cocaine addict, a victim of child sexual abuse, a fetish model and, briefly, a sex worker at One Eyed Jacks, a casino/brothel just north of the Canada–US border. Officially involved with Bobby Briggs, the high school football team captain, she was also engaged in a secret relationship with James Hurley. She also had sexual encounters with other Twin Peaks citizens, such as businessman Ben Horne and trucker/drug dealer Leo Johnson.The discovery of Laura's body in the pilot episode of Twin Peaks brings Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) to investigate her death. Her murder and its effect on those around her propel the first season and the first eight episodes of the second season. Laura remains a prominent character afterward, as her death exposes many secrets related to her, and also, in some cases, unrelated, such as the Packard mill conspiracy. Laura also appears in Cooper's dreams, offering cryptic clues as to the identity of her killer.Laura's first diary is uncovered in the first episode, but her 2nd secret diary is not recovered until later. The secret diary contains passages suggesting that she had been sexually abused by a malevolent entity named BOB (Frank Silva) since she was a child. In her diary she referred to BOB as a friend of her father's.In the prequel/sequel Fire Walk With Me, Laura's spirit makes the transition to the afterlife when an angel appears to her, showing that her nightmare was finally over.During the second season, the identity of her murderer was revealed: her father, Leland, who had sexually abused her for years while being possessed by BOB. Before his death in police custody, Leland tells Cooper and the others that he hadn't been aware of his own actions during the times BOB possessed him. As Leland dies, Laura appears before him in a vision, and it is implied that she forgives him and welcomes him to the afterlife.Laura appears inside the Black Lodge during the series finale, as both herself and an evil doppelgänger version."

      "desc":"Donna is first seen walking to her locker at school, amused at the sight of Audrey Horne changing into heels and smoking a cigarette a few lockers down. She then went to class and saw a deputy enter the classroom as the teacher was taking attendance, asking if Bobby Briggs was in the class. She looked at Laura Palmer's empty desk and began to cry. She was brought in for questioning before Sheriff Harry S. Truman and FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, where she was asked about the picnic with Laura that was filmed by James Hurley, but she insisted that it was recorded by a female hiker. Donna snuck out and went to the Roadhouse, where a fight broke out because of Donna's boyfriend Mike. Donna was escorted to James in the woods. Donna told him that the authorities were looking for him. When they drove off, they were stopped by the sheriff and Agent Cooper. The next morning, Donna expressed guilt she felt for her feelings for James to her mother. She went to the Palmer home, and talked to Sarah Palmer, but she began to believe that Donna was her daughter and became hysterical. The next day, she went to the Double R Diner and when Audrey Horne entered, Donna went to speak to her and they talked about Laura's death and Audrey's admiration for Agent Cooper.The following day, Donna attended Laura's funeral. At school, Donna was doing her makeup when Audrey came in and told her that she was aware of the secrets surrounding Laura's life, including that she had been seeing Doctor Lawrence Jacoby, something that Donna didn't know. Later, she went to the woods with James to find the other half of the necklace that they buried but they could not find it. Donna later went to the Double R Diner with him, where she met Laura's cousin, Maddy Ferguson. She asked Maddy to assist them in their investigation into Laura's death. Later that night, Maddy called Donna and told her that she found a tape in Laura's hiding place. Donna listened to the tape and realized that it was recorded for Doctor Jacoby. She discovers that a tape recorded the night Laura died is missing. James believes that Jacoby must be in possession of it and suggested they go to Jacoby's office to find the tape, and they could lure him out with a \"phone call from Laura.\" Later, she met Maddy and James in the park, the former wearing a blonde wig to make her look identical to Laura. Maddy deceived Jacoby by speaking as Laura on the phone. Donna and James infiltrated his office as he left. Donna found the missing tape and half of Laura's necklace. At Donna's house, they listened to the tape, in which Laura mentioned a \"mystery man\" who drove a red corvette. She went to the Double R Diner the next day and met with Maddy. Maddy questioned if they were responsible for a heart attack suffered by Doctor Jacoby. Maddy then informed her that Leland's hair had turned white. Donna called Norma and expressed interest in doing Laura's route for the Meals on Wheels. Donna told Maddy about the Meals on Wheels. Starting on the route, Donna went to the home of an elderly woman named Mrs. Tremond, who told her about the neighbor, Harold Smith and revealed that he was friends with Laura. Smith did not answer so Donna left him a note. Her father told her that Harold Smith called her. They arranged to meet the next day. The next morning, she went to Harold's home and they talked about Laura before he went to his greenhouse to get a flower for Laura's grave. She begins to confide in Harold and starts to develop feelings for him. While looking at Harold's flowers she discovers Laura's secret diary. While having lunch with Harold, Donna offers to tell her life story to him if she could read Laura's diary, but agrees but says that he will read it to her and that it can't leave the room. She snatched the diary and walked outside of Harold's house. He stepped outside and collapsed. Out of guilt, Donna apologizes and returns the diary. Still seeking answers to Laura's murder, Donna and Maddy set up a plan to steal the diary. She met with Harold and discusses a memory she had with Laura when she was a kid where they went skinny-dipping with a group of older boys. She said that this experience was the first time that she fell in love, with one of the boys named Tim. Harold kissed her. When Harold left, Maddy went inside to search for the diary. She tried to distract Harold while Maddy searched for the diary, but their plan was foiled.Donna reported to the authorities that Harold was in possession of Laura's diary but her claims were met with skepticism as they already discovered a diary at the Palmer house. At the Roadhouse, Donna expressed her guilt and sadness over Harold's suicide. Donna soon reconnects with James. At the diner, Donna heard Deputy Andy saying, \"J'ai une âme solitaire,\" and she questioned him about Mrs. Tremond, but he said this was actually Harold Smith's suicide note and that it meant, \"I am a lonely soul.\" Donna went to Agent Cooper and told him about her and they went to her house, but a different Mrs. Tremond answered the door. She gave an envelope to Donna from Harold, containing a page from Laura's diary, where she described a dream of being in a red room, the mysterious \"BOB\", and her being aware of her death the following night. Donna went to the Palmer house to deliver a tape for Maddy, and became fearful while listening to Leland's conversation with Maddy's mother as she didn't make it home. James leaves Twin Peaks and Donna soon discovers a connection between her mother and Ben Horne. Intrigued, Donna followed her to the Great Northern Hotel, discovering that she planned to meet Ben Horne. Audrey Horne assists her with her investigation. Upon discovering flowers sent to her mother, Donna finds her birth certificate and discovers that it did not list a father. Donna realizes that Ben Horne is her biological father."

      "desc":"In the pilot episode of the series, Leland is called into the morgue to identify Laura's body. The grief pushes him over the edge; he throws himself into the grave at Laura's funeral and has to be dragged out, and for the next few weeks he manically asks people - even complete strangers - to dance with him as Laura had, all while sobbing hysterically. When Jacques Renault is arrested as a suspect in Laura's murder, Leland murders him by suffocating him with a pillow. After killing Jacques, Leland's hair turns white overnight. Leland is arrested, but released on a personal recognizance bond pending trial due to personal assurances made by Sheriff Harry S. Truman that he does not pose any danger to the community. Leland's behavior at times appears abnormal - manically happy at times, exhibited by singing the 1940s popular nonsense song \"Mairzy Doats\", before crashing into grief. The arrival of his niece-in-law Madeline \"Maddy\" Ferguson, who looks almost exactly like Laura, is of great help to him in learning how to deal with his daughter's death. It is eventually revealed that, as a boy, Leland met a strange neighbor who turned out to be a demonic entity named BOB, who would possess him throughout his life. It is also implied that BOB molested him as a child. It is difficult to tell when and if Leland is truly in control of himself and when he is being possessed by BOB. It is implied that Leland killed Jacques Renault on his own – not under BOB's control – and that Leland is lost from that point: he is no longer able to stop BOB and is completely taken over, physically manifested by the change of hair color and a dramatic change in behavior. Finally, BOB takes control of Leland and murders Maddy. The changes in Leland from this point help Special Agent Dale Cooper to finally identify him as BOB's \"host\". Leland is eventually exposed as the murderer of both his daughter and his niece Maddy and is arrested by Cooper and Truman. He later dies in custody following a bizarre interrogation on the night of his arrest. BOB takes control of Leland and forces him to run headfirst into the metal door of an interrogation room. At the moment of his death, Leland remembers the crimes he committed under BOB's control, and cries out in agony. After Cooper recites the last rites from the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Leland sees a vision of his daughter Laura and dies. Later on, Cooper explains to the widowed Sarah that he believes the vision was of Laura forgiving Leland and welcoming him into the afterlife.In the final episode of the series, Cooper encounters a grinning doppelgänger of Leland in the Black Lodge, who says \"I did not kill anybody.\""
