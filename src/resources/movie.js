      "plot":"James and Laura go to the woods and start to make out, but she tells James his Laura is gone. Screaming that she loves him, Laura runs away from James into the woods. Laura meets Ronette, Jacques, and Leo, and they hold an orgy in Jacques's cabin as Leland watches from outside. Jacques wants to have hard sex and ties Laura up. Leland attacks Jacques outside, and Leo flees in panic; Leland takes Laura and Ronette, both bound, to the train car. Meanwhile, Mike realizes that BOB/Leland is about to kill again, and chases after him. BOB/Leland takes a mirror and says he'll kill Laura if she won't let him inside her. Mike tries to get into the train car, and when Leland sees Ronette trying to let him in, he knocks her unconscious and kicks her out of the train car. Mike drops Teresa's ring as he flees the scene. Laura wears the ring, preventing BOB from going inside her. Angered that he can't enter her anymore, he brutally stabs her to death. BOB/Leland dumps Laura's body in the lake. As her corpse drifts away, BOB/Leland enters the Black Lodge, where he encounters Mike and the arm (who is seated at Mike's left side as the aforementioned arm). They tell BOB that they want their Garmonbozia (pain and sorrow). BOB returns it in the form of blood. Will Hayward unwraps Laura's corpse the next morning.",
